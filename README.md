# Java Spring Boot Showcase

Welcome to my Java Spring Boot Showcase! This project demonstrates my understanding of various Java Spring Boot technologies and core Java features.

## Technologies Used

### Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a powerful framework for building Java-based applications with minimal configuration. In this project, I've utilized Spring Boot to create a robust and efficient backend for my application.

### Spring Security

Security is a crucial aspect of any web application. With Spring Security, I've implemented authentication and authorization features to ensure secure access to my application's endpoints.

### Spring Data JPA

Spring Data JPA simplifies data access in Spring applications by providing an easy-to-use abstraction over JPA (Java Persistence API). With Spring Data JPA, I've implemented seamless interaction with the database, allowing for efficient data manipulation and retrieval.

### Input Validation

Input validation is essential for ensuring data integrity and preventing security vulnerabilities. Leveraging Spring's validation capabilities, I've implemented robust input validation mechanisms to sanitize user inputs and enforce data constraints.

### Exception Handling

Exception handling is critical for gracefully managing errors and maintaining application stability. With Spring's exception handling features, I've implemented robust error handling strategies to gracefully handle exceptions and provide meaningful error responses to clients.

### Localization and Internationalization

Localization and internationalization are vital for creating applications that cater to a global audience. Using Spring's internationalization support, I've implemented multi-language support, allowing users to interact with the application in their preferred language.

## Core Java Features

In addition to Spring Boot technologies, this project also showcases my proficiency in core Java features, including:

- Object-oriented programming
- Collections framework
- Exception handling
- Generics
- Lambdas and streams

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the application using Maven or your preferred IDE.

## Note: Work in Progress

Please note that this project is a work in progress, and some features may not yet be complete. I am continuously working on enhancing and refining the application to showcase my skills effectively.
